# Movie Search
For movie lovers, a program that helps you choose a movie when you are undecided or do not know what to watch.

## How does it work:
  1. You must have a _Discord_ account. For this app is the communication with the bot.
  2. If you want to choose a random movie, you send a message to the bot saying `$random`. The same would be done to choose a specific gender.
  3. The bot will send the title of the selected movie and the link of the page that contains the information.
  4. If you do not like the selected movie, you can resend another request as many times as you like.

## Options to choose:
You can choose a movie at random or specify which genre you would like to see.
The available genres are:
  - Comedy
  - Sci-Fi
  - Horror
  - Romance
  - Action
  - Thriller
  - Drama
  - Mystery
  - Crime
  - Animation
  - Adventure
